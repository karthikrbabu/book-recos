## Notebooks

## Demo

In the ```\flask_be``` folder you will find a file called ```api.py``` the development Python server code that houses all our exposed APIs. These APIs are interfaces for our front-end React application to make requests to fetch a variety of recommendations. The annotated APIs that are constructed in here are built off work done in various scratch notebooks
