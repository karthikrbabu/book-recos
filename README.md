### Team:

## Goal

## Data

## Notebooks 

In the ```\scratch_notebooks``` folder you will find all of our development notebooks by topic. Each has annotations and descriptions/explanations on the steps taken. The work done in these notebooks ultimately is showcased with the final models we have used, and visuals we have created for our presentation.

## Demo

In the ```\flask_be``` folder you will find a file called ```api.py``` the development Python server code that houses all our exposed APIs. These APIs are interfaces for our front-end React application to make requests to fetch a variety of recommendations. The annotated APIs that are constructed in here are built off work done in various scratch notebooks
